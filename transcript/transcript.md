## Keynote

Moderator: * So that was your applause, Glenn! Welcome to the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, in Hamburg. The floor is yours!*

Thank you, thank you very much.

Thank you everybody, for that warm welcome, and thank you as well to
the Congress organizers for inviting me to speak.

My reaction when I learned that I had been asked to deliver the
keynote to this conference was probably similar to the one some of you
had, which was, "wait, what?"

And the reason is that my cryptographic and hacker skills are not
exactly world-reknowned. You know, the story has been told many times
of how I almost lost the biggest national security story in the last
decade, at least because I found the installation of PGP to be
insurmountably annoying and difficult.

[applause]

There's another story, that's very similar, that illustrates the same
point, that I actually don't think has been told before, which is:
prior to my going to Hong Kong, I spent many hours with both Laura
Poitras and Edward Snowden, trying to get up to speed on the basics of
security technology that I would need in order to report on this
story. They tried to tutor me in all sorts of programs, and finally
concluded that the only one, at least at that time, for that moment,
that I could handle, was [TrueCrypt](https://truecrypt.org). 

They taught me the basics of TrueCrypt, and when I went to Hong Kong,
before I went to sleep, I would play around with TrueCrypt. I kind of
taught myself a couple of functions that they hadn't even taught me
and really had this sort of confidence.

On the third or fourth day, I went over to meet both of them, and I
was beaming with pride. I showed them all of the new things that I had
taught myself how to do on TrueCrypt, and pronounced myself this
Cryptographic Master. That I was really becoming advanced.

I looked at both of them, and I didn't see any return pride coming my
way. Actually, what I saw was them trying, really hard, to avoid
rolling their eyes out of their heads at me, to one another.

I said, "Why are you reacting that way? Why isn't that a great
accomplishment?" They sort of let some moments go by. No one wanted to
break it to me until finally Snowden piped in and said, "TrueCrypt is
really meant for your little kid brother to be able to master. It's
not all that impressive."

[laughter from the audience]

I remember being very deflated, and kind of going back to the drawing
board. Well, that was six months ago. In the interim, the importance
of security technology and privacy technology has become really
central to what it is that I do
