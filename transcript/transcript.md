## Keynote

Moderator: *So that was your applause, Glenn! Welcome to the 30th Chaos Communication Congress, in Hamburg. The floor is yours!*

Thank you, thank you very much.

Thank you everybody, for that warm welcome, and thank you as well to
the Congress organizers for inviting me to speak.

My reaction when I learned that I had been asked to deliver the
keynote to this conference was probably similar to the one some of you
had, which was, "wait, what?"

[laughter from the audience]

And the reason is that my cryptographic and hacker skills are not
exactly world-reknowned. You know, the story has been told many times
of how I almost lost the biggest national security story in the last
decade, at least because I found the installation of PGP to be
insurmountably annoying and difficult.

[applause]

There's another story, that's very similar, that illustrates the same
point, that I actually don't think has been told before, which is:
prior to my going to Hong Kong, I spent many hours with both Laura
Poitras and Edward Snowden, trying to get up to speed on the basics of
security technology that I would need in order to report on this
story. They tried to tutor me in all sorts of programs, and finally
concluded that the only one, at least at that time, for that moment,
that I could handle, was [TrueCrypt](https://truecrypt.org). 

They taught me the basics of TrueCrypt, and when I went to Hong Kong,
before I went to sleep, I would play around with TrueCrypt. I kind of
taught myself a couple of functions that they hadn't even taught me
and really had this sort of confidence.

On the third or fourth day, I went over to meet both of them, and I
was beaming with pride. I showed them all of the new things that I had
taught myself how to do on TrueCrypt, and pronounced myself this
Cryptographic Master. That I was really becoming advanced.

I looked at both of them, and I didn't see any return pride coming my
way. Actually, what I saw was them trying, really hard, to avoid
rolling their eyes out of their heads at me, to one another.

I said, "Why are you reacting that way? Why isn't that a great
accomplishment?" They sort of let some moments go by. No one wanted to
break it to me until finally Snowden piped in and said, "TrueCrypt is
really meant for your little kid brother to be able to master. It's
not all that impressive."

[laughter from the audience]

I remember being very deflated, and kind of going back to the drawing
board. Well, that was six months ago. In the interim, the importance
of security technology and privacy technology has become really
central to everything it is that I do. I really have learned an
enormous amount, about both its importance and how it functions. I'm
far from the only one. I think one of the most significant outcomes of
the last six months, but one of the most underdiscussed, is how many
people now appreciate the importance of protecting the security of
their communications.

If you go and look at my inbox from July, probably 3-5% of the emails
I received were composed of PGP code. That percentage is definitely
above 50% today, and probably well above 50%. When we talked about
forming our new media company, we barely spent any time on the
question. It was simply assumed that we were all going to use the most
sophisticated encryption that was available to communicate with one
another. 

I think, most encouragingly, whenever I'm contacted by anyone in
journalism or activism, or any related fields, they either use
encryption, or are embarrassed and ashamed that they dont, and
apologize for the fact that they don't, and vow that they're soon
going to.

It's a really remarkable sea-change, even from the middle of last
year, when I would talk to some of the leading national security
journalists *in the world* who were working on some of the most
sensitive information, and virtually none of them knew what PGP or OTR
or any other of the leading privacy technologies were, let alone how
to use them. It's really encouraging to see this technology spreading
so pervasively. 

I think that this underscores a really important point, one that gives
me great cause for optimism. I'm often asked whether I think that the
stories that we've been learning over the last six months, the
reporting and the debates that have arisen will actually change
anything and impose any real limits on the US surveillance state.

Typically, when people think the answer to that question is yes, the
thing that they cite most commonly is probably [really significant],
which is that there's going to be some kind of debate, and our
representatives in democratic government are going to respond to our
debate, and they're going to impose limits with legislative reform.

None of that is likely to happen. The US government and its allies are
not going to voluntarily restrict their own surveillance powers in any
meaningful way. In fact, the tactic of the US government that we've
seen over and over, that we've seen historically, is to do the very
opposite, which is that when they get caught doing something that
brings them disrepute and causes scandal and concern, they're very
adept at pretending to reform themselves through symbolic gestures,
while at the same time, doing very little, other than placating
citizen anger and often increasing their own powers, that created the
scandal in the first place.
